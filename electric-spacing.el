;;; Commentary:

;; Smart Operator mode is a minor mode which automatically inserts
;; surrounding spaces around operator symbols.  For example, `='
;; becomes ` = ', `+=' becomes ` += '.  This is most handy for writing
;; C-style source code.
;;
;; Type `M-x electric-spacing-mode' to toggle this minor mode.

;;; Acknowledgements

;; Nikolaj Schumacher <n_schumacher@web.de>, for suggesting
;; reimplementing as a minor mode and providing an initial patch for
;; that.

With a prefix argument ARG, enable Electric Spacing mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

This is a local minor mode.  When enabled, typing an operator automatically
inserts surrounding spaces.  e.g., `=' becomes ` = ',`+=' becomes ` += '.  This
is very handy for many programming languages."
